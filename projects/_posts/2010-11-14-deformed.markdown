**de:formed** is a project created for the 120ft (36.6m) long video wall at the [IAC][iac-url] headquarters in NYC. It was coded in OpenFrameworks and employed a multiprojector / multicomputer setup.

Inspired by the work of Ryoji Ikeda, sine waves were used as graphic generators to create the desired digital aesthetic.

de:formed is a collaborative project with [Tamar Ziv][tamar-url]
