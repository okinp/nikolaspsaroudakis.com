**Using sustainable energy to harm the environment**

*(un)sustainable* is a project that consists of a lighting device that uses sustainable energy in an unconventional way. It is a reaction to the sustainable everything trend in design, advertising and consuming.

The project aims to highlight the paradoxical behavior of environmentally conscious uber-cosumers by creating and highlighting another paradox. It uses a sustainable form of energy to produce the opposite effect of the expected one and harm the environment.

The device is connected to the electrical grid and draws power from it, but uses wind power to sense the intensity at which it needs to operate. The operation of the device ensures that non-green energy is consumed when least needed, while wasting natural resources.

This project wouldnâ€™t be possible without the very kind donation of anemometer rotors by [Inspeed][inspeed].
