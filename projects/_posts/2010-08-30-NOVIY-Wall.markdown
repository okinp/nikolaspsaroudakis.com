The *Franco-Russian Poster Wall* is one of the interactive projects [Potion][potion] created for the Moscow based Noviy Restaurant & Bar.

I worked on the wall project - while a developer intern at Potion - during the summer of 2010, making the posters tearable. The project was created in a precursor of Potion’s open source - C++ based framework, [PoCode][pocode].

The NOVIY project has received several awards, including:

- The I.D. magazine’s [Annual Design Review award][idmag] (Interactive, 2011).

- The [CommArts award][commarts] (Interactives,2012).

More info about the project can be found in Potion’s [website][projectpage].
