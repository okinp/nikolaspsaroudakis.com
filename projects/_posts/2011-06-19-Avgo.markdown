*Avgo* is a chair that was inspired by Henrik Thor-Larsenâ€™s *Ovalia* egg shaped chair. It was designed in Vectorworks and fabricated using a CNC mill. No glue or screws were used in the assembly of the chair, since the slices were press-fitted together.

Avgo was featured in [Core77][core77] and exhibited in [3rd Ward][3rdWard] and the ITP Spring Show in 2011.

Avgo was designed and fabricated with [Michael Doherty][mzd].
