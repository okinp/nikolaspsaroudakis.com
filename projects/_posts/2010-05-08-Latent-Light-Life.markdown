*Latent Light Life* is an interactive video installation, where participants use their voice to scare light creatures out of hiding.

As cars are cleared-off of streets and the sun sets, life forms made out of light begin to emerge from street objects such as fire hydrants and newspaper stands. When participants yell, speak, or sing at these street objects, the light creatures are encouraged to come out of hiding.

Latent Light Life has been displayed in the ITP Spring â€˜10 Show and the 2010 Vimeo Festival & Awards [Vimeo World][world] pop-up gallery in NYC.

Latent Light Life was created with [Michael Doherty][mzd] in OpenFrameworks.
