Nikolas Psaroudakis (Paris, 1977) is an Athens based maker, developer and artist.

Nikolas holds a BSc in Physics from the [University of Kent][kent] (UK), an MSc by research in Physics from the same university and is an alumnus of the [Interactive Telecommunications Program][itp] (ITP), Tisch / NYU.

His Physics MSc had nothing to do with Physics but was within the area of Image Processing & Computer Vision. His thesis was entitled “Human Face Detection in Color Images Using Gaussian Scale-Space Theory and Hidden Markov Models” and is by far the most difficult challenge he has tackled so far.

While at ITP he explored the intersection of art & technology by creating physical devices with custom electronics and sensors and by developing interactive installations using code & cameras.

His interests include code-based design, interactive installations, tangible interfaces, digital fabrication and physical computing.
